## ‚≠êÔ∏èFeatures

### Create a Map

The home page is where you will view all your maps, and on the navbar there is a <b>add new map</b> button which lets you create a new map with a given heading, theme, and description. This map will be displayed on your home page once you create it.

### Add locations to Map

When user clicks and opens a owned map, they can add/delete a location from the map. To add a new location to map, user can search a location, click on a location pin, give it a name and description and hit the add button.
